### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Jakob.
* I've been involved with the Apache Software Foundation ([Foundation Member](https://www.apache.org/foundation/members), IPMC member) and sundry big data projects there (Committer/PMC Member: [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Samza](https://samza.apache.org/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), etc.) for many years.
* Engineers do a weird thing where we list the companies we've benen at, like they were some heraldic houses or something.  Anyway, here's mine: Yahoo!-LinkedIn-Microsoft-OfferUp-Lyft.  (It's weird, right?)
* I like coding in Rust, Kotlin, Java and, when pressed, Python or Scala.
* Currently I am interested in WebAssembly and its application to data storage and processing. This means things like [Lance](https://github.com/lancedb/lance), [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) and [LlamaEdge](https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge)
* If you're interested in chatting with me, you likely know how to reach me.  In that case, feel free to do so.
