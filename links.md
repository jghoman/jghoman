## Engineering culture/jobs
- [Principal/Staff Engineer Resources](https://www.mayerdan.com/career/2022/01/04/principal-engineer-resources)

## Random programming stuff
- [Learn Assembly Language](https://asmtutor.com/) - Really nice, bite sized sections. Want to steal format.

## Annoyances
- [Flatpack has its own view of the filesystem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54499133/cant-select-home-directory-for-jdk-because-intellij-cant-see-it) - Applicable to IntelliJ installed via Software Update. Probably don't want to do that.
